# selenium-openaws-console
Automation tool for AWS console login.


## Overview
Assuming you are working on multiple AWS consoles simultaneously across different account IDs, you might switch IAM role(s) back and forth. Eventually, the role history would be fully consumed. The first IAM role you have used is out of history. You may even attempt to open a number of browser windows and login, but it fails because these windows share the same session.

This tool can open up AWS console windows across multiple AWS accounts without boring and repetitive ID/PW input.
